# Environments/development

The goal for this project is to share a set of `docker-compose.yml` files. Those
files - which may be named `docker-compose.<use-case>.yml` or
`docker-compose.<application>.yml`, etc. - can be used to run code in various
stages of development (staging, production). Although, it is worth noting that
other tools are employed (e.g., terraform, kubernetes) to address use cases
beyond simply running applications or services.
